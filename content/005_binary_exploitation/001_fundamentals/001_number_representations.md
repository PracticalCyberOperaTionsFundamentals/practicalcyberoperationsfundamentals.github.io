# Number representations

At their core, all digital data is just 0s and 1s arranged in a particular
order. That's a little reductive, but it is very important.

We highly recommend that you get comfortable with base 16 and ASCII, if nothing
else.

## Bases

Most humans count in base 10. That is, we count up to 9, then regroup, placing
a 1 in the next digit and resetting the current digit to 0. This is sometimes
referred to as "decimal." In computing, a number without additional markings
is usually in base 10. It may also be specified by `d` for "decimal," such as
`15d` meaning fifteen, or `%d` indicating a number that will be represented in
decimal.

We could, however, count in other bases. These are sometimes referred to as a radix
(radices, for plural). The most common bases in computing are base 2 (binary),
base 8 (octal), and base 16 (hexadecimal).

Generally speaking, the "ones" digit is normal, but the other digits, such as
the "tens" digit or the "hundreds" digit, are just the powers of the base. For
example, in base 10, the "tens" digit is 10^1, and the "hundreds" digit is
10^2. In base 2, however, the "tens" digit is 2^1, and the "hundreds" digit is
2^2. Hopefully this will make sense soon!

### Base 2

Base 2, or binary, uses just two digits: 0 and 1. Here is a table of the numbers
0 to 16 in binary:

| Base 10 | Base 2 |
| - | - |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 11 |
| 4 | 100 |
| 5 | 101 |
| 6 | 110 |
| 7 | 111 |
| 8 | 1000 |
| 9 | 1001 |
| 10 | 1010 |
| 11 | 1011 |
| 12 | 1100 |
| 13 | 1101 |
| 14 | 1110 |
| 15 | 1111 |
| 16 | 10000 |


Binary is represented with a `b`. Numbers may be marked with the prefix `0b`,
such as `0b100`, or with the suffix `b`, as in `100b`. In formatting, you will
usually see `%b`.

### Base 8

Base 8, or octal, uses the digits 0 to 7. Here is a table of the numbers 0 to
16 in octal:

| Base 10 | Base 8 |
| - | - |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 6 |
| 7 | 7 |
| 8 | 10 |
| 9 | 11 |
| 10 | 12 |
| 11 | 13 |
| 12 | 14 |
| 13 | 15 |
| 14 | 16 |
| 15 | 17 |
| 16 | 20 |

Octal is represented with an `o`. Numbers may be marked with the prefix `0o`,
such as `0o11`, or with the suffix `o`, as in `11o`. You may also see just the
prefix of `0`, such as `011` meaning the octal number `0o11`. Of the
representations on this page, you will see this one the least. In formatting,
you will usually see `%o`.

### Base 16

Base 16, or hexadecimal, or simply hex for short, uses all of the regular
digits, plus the first 6 letters of the alphabet (a-f). Here is a table of the
numbers 0 to 16 in hex:

| Base 10 | Base 8 |
| - | - |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 6 |
| 7 | 7 |
| 8 | 8 |
| 9 | 9 |
| 10 | a |
| 11 | b |
| 12 | c |
| 13 | d |
| 14 | e |
| 15 | f |
| 16 | 10 |

Hex is represented with an `h` or an `x`. Numbers may be marked with the prefix
`0x` as in `0x10` or with the suffix `h`, as in `10h`. However, hex may not
always be represented with anything. This can be confusing for numbers that do
not contain letters, such as `1234`. This typically depends on the context.
In formatting, hex is `%x`.

Besides decimal, hex is the most common. This is because maps very well to
binary and because two hex digits represents one byte. This is used to
represent instruction codes, addresses, and just about anything that is binary.

## ASCII

ASCII, short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is the
character encoding for the main symbols of the English language, including the
alphabet and punctuation found on an English keyboard. There are also control
characters, such as the newline character and end-of-file (EOF) character.
The exact table can be found online in numerous places.

ASCII is the same as the first 128 characters of Unicode, which is expanded to
support non-English characters, such as characters with accents and non-Latin
alphabets.

There are exactly 128 ASCII characters, and therefore it can be represented by
one byte. Because of this, sometimes bytes and characters, and therefore text,
are intertwined, even when they don't need to be. This is a crucial part of
binary exploitation, as many vulnerabilities arise from text input being parsed
as data.

ASCII characters are represented by their characters, or with a leading `\`,
called escape sequences. For example, the newline character is `\n`, and the
tab character is `\t`. Some characters do not have either, in which their name
or their integer value (in hex) is the best representation of it.

ASCII characters are represented with a `%c` in formatting.

## Two's complement and floating point

Negative numbers and floating point numbers are represented differently.
Because we only really have positive integers in digital computing, some data
may be interpreted differently based on the context.

Floating point numbers are represented in a format specified by the IEEE 754
standard. If you are interested, you can read more about it online.

Negative numbers use a format called two's complement, which divides a given
bit-length in half to make room for negative numbers. For example, if I had
3 bits (and therefore 2^3=8 numbers), half of them would be negative:

| Decimal | Binary |
| - | - |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 11 |
| -4 | 100 |
| -3 | 101 |
| -2 | 110 |
| -1 | 111 |

As you can observe, all negative numbers in two's complement begin with the bit
1.

Sometimes, you will see very large numbers used in addition. Because of two's
complement, this may mean subtraction of a small-magnitude negative number. In
addition, to preserve the sign, certain bit shift operations may preserve the
leading 1. For example, `-4 >> 1` should result in `-2`, so `100` becomes
shifted to `110` in the table above.
