# Binary exploitation

## What is binary exploitation?

Binary exploitation, sometimes referred to as "pwn" (pronounced "pown") is the
act of misusing programs, typically compiled binary programs, to do things they
were not intended to do.

This could include modifying files, changing database information, or granting
access to unauthorized users.

We highly recommend the reverse engineering chapter before this one.

## Overview

In this chapter, we will go over the core strategies of binary exploitation,
including a review the x86 and x86-64 instruction set architectures (ISA).

We will go over these strategies:
- Buffer overflows
- `ret2win`
- `ret2libc`
- Shellcode
- Format string attacks
- Getting around binary protections
    - ASLR/PIE
    - Stack guards / stack canaries
    - Non-executable stacks
- Return-oriented programming (ROP)
- Reverse shells
