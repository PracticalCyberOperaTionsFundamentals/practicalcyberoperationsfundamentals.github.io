The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents a web page's structure. It turns the HTML of a page into a tree of objects that JavaScript can access and modify. This lets developers change text, styles, and elements dynamically like updating content, reacting to user input, or showing/hiding parts of the page.
