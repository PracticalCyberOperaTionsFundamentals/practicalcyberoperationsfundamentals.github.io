### Fuzzing
When making use of Zap, there is an important tool and concept known as fuzzing. Lets say there is an important directory that acts as an admin access portal that you want to interact with, but you don't know what route it's served on. 
One way to discover the route is to try a bunch of likely names for the route, like .../admin, .../administrator, .../adm, etc.
