A **website** is a collection of files, mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that work together to present and exchange information over the internet. While websites are most commonly accessed through web browsers, they can also be used by other tools and systems, such as screen readers, bots, mobile apps, and command-line tools. Websites can serve many purposes, including sharing content, enabling interaction, or powering web-based applications.
